# ETL-Pipeline-with-Apache-Airflow
(i) In Exercise1, we finished the process_web_log data pipeline process with 4 tasks.

(ii) In Exercise2, We did test runs for each of the tasks we defined and a test run for the workflow.Additionally, we triggered the workflow and monitored a few runs. Document the test runs with our findings or observations from the runs.

(iii) In Exercise3, we added to the workflow a task that implemented sending a message to Slack after the last task.
